# What is AWS?

[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://aws.amazon.com) is a collection of cloud based web services you can use for a monthly fee.

It was invented when [Amazon faced scaling issues](http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-amazon-exposed-its-guts-the-history-of-awss-ec2/) with their retail website in the early 2000s and opened up to the public crowd in 2006.

Today AWS is [one of the largest cloud providers](http://www.businessinsider.de/why-amazon-is-so-hard-to-topple-in-the-cloud-and-where-everybody-else-falls-2015-10) and powers a huge amount of the internet (e.g. [Netflix](http://netflix.com), [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com), [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com) or [Slack](http://slack.com)). Here are some case studies if you're interested how AWS helps companies scale their business.

The available services range from servers (EC2), to storage (S3) up to devices you can use to test your applications (Device Farm).

If you want an overview what's available you should check out their [product page](https://aws.amazon.com/products/) which lists and structures every available service.

Don't get too confused about the overwhelming number of services you can rent. Understand AWS as a service provider where you have access to different services you need while developing a modern application.

Sounds interesting but you don't want to spent a bunch of money monthly to play around and get used to their services? Amazon has you covered. There's a very attractive [starter plan](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) available which allows you to get familiar with their services for free.

I'd recommend that you'll sign up for the free account so you can use the full potential of the Serverless framework and see the power of modern, serverless applications.
